Solves the Schroedinger equation on a finite one-dimensional interval using
the discrete variable representation method with the Fourier sine basis.
Requires Python and NumPy, optionally Matplotlib for plotting.

Source the env.sh file to use the package. See the examples directory for some
inspiration and colorful quantum mechanics.
